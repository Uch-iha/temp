I am creating a Capstone project for my coding bootcamp and would love to use your API to detect emotions in my school project. For my project, I am looking to build a App that analyzes input video to detect emotions and return a emotion that will counteract the input emotions to a better state. My goal would be able to incorporate this feature to robotics to help sick kids feel better because laughter is the best medicine.
